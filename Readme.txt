To change the name of multiple files(they had the same name) just take those steps:


first_place the Raname.exe at the same place with your multiple files.


Second_for ex:  Egybest.Vikings.Ep.01.720p Egybest.Vikings.Ep.02.720p Egybest.Vikings.Ep.03.720p

What you gonna do:
1- Enter the first part of the file(ignore the number): Egybest.Vikings.Ep.
2-Enter the second part of the file + the type (here .mp4):.720p.mp4 

the same steps until the end.
